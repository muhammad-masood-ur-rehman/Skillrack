School Chocolate Distribution
Spectrum International School is located in DonnaVille. Chocolates are distributed on certain days (like a festival, independence day) to the N students present on that day. The number of chocolates to be distributed is C.
The first student F to be given the chocolate is randomly chosen and the C chocolates are distributed one each to a student in sequence from F till they are emptied. Given F, the program print the number of the student who receives the last chocolate.
Input Format:
First line contains total number of test cases, denoted by T
Next T lines, contain a tuple containing 3 values delimited by space
N C F, where
- N denotes the number of students
- C denotes the number of chocolates
- F denotes the number of the student who receives the first chocolate.
Output Format:
The number of the student who receives the last chocolate.
Boundary Conditions / Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 999999999
1 <= C <= 999999999
1 <= F <= N
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
3
5 3 1
10 7 9
6 17 4
Output:
3
5
2
Explanation:
The first line in the input denotes there are 3 test cases.
In 5 3 1, the 3 chocolates are distributed to students with numbers 1,2,3. Hence 3 is the output.
In 10 7 9, the 7 chocolates are distributed to students with numbers 9 10 1 2 3 4 5. Hence 5 is the output.
In 6 17 4, the 17 chocolates are distributed to students with numbers 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2. Hence 2 is the output.

            printf("%d\n",n-1);
        }
        else{
            printf("%d\n",(f+c)%n-1);
        }
