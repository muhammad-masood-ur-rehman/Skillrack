Odd Even Row - Pattern Printing
Given a value of N, where N is the number of rows, the program must print the character '*' from left or right depending on whether the row is an odd row or an even row.
- If it is an odd row, the '*' must start from left.
- If it is an even row, the '*' must start from right.
After the asterisk '*' the numbers from 1 to the row count must be printed.
Input Format:
The first line will contain the value of N
Output Format:
N lines will contain '*' forming the pattern as described.
