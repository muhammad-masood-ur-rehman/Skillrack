X to Z Ascending - Y to X Descending
Three positive integers X, Y and Z are passed as the input to the program. The program must print from X to Z in the forward direction and then print from Y to X in the reverse direction.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= X < Y < Z <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains X, Y and Z separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the values from X to Z separated by a space.
The second line contains the values from Y to X separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5 10 15
Output:
5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
