Digits Division Count
A number N is passed as input to the program. The program must print the count of digits which divide the number N without leaving a remainder.
Input Format:
The first line contains N
Output Format:
The first line contains the count of digits which divide N without leaving a remainder.
Boundary Conditions:
1 <= N <= 9999999999

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
11012
Output:
4
Explanation:
The digits are 1 1 0 1 2. Division by zero is not defined. Hence that is excluded.
Three 1s and the 2 divide 11012 without leaving a remainder. Hence 4 is the output/
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
209
Output:
0
Explanation:
None of the digits 2 or 9 divide 209 without leaving a remainder. Division by zero is undefined. Hence 0 is printed as the output.
a=input().strip()
print(len([i for i in a if i!='0' and int(a)%int(i)==0]))
