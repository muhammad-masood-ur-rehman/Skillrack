Two Policemen Catching a Thief
Policeman1 and Policeman2 along with a thief are standing on X-axis. The integral value of their location on the X-axis is passed as the input.
Both the policemen run at the same speed and they start running at the same time to catch the thief.
· The program must print Police1 if Policeman1 will catch the thief first.
· The program must print Police2 if Policeman2 will catch the thief first.
· The program must print Both if Policeman1 and Policeman2 will reach the thief at the same time.
Input Format:
The first line will contain the value of N which represents the number of test cases to be passed as the input.
Next N lines will contain the integral location of Policeman1, Policeman2 and the thief each separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line will contain one of the following values - Police1, Police2, Both
Constraints:
