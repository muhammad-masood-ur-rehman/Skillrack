Relatives Meeting
Relatives Meeting: There is a village festival happening in which several group of relatives meet every year. Each person is allocated an identifier which is a positive integer.
N pairs of relatives identifiers are passed as input. Then finally given a person's identifier I, the program must print the count of the relatives C  in the group of the person with the identifier I.
Input Format:
The first line contains the values of N.
N lines contain the identifiers of two persons who are related.
The next line (N+2)th line, will contain the identifier I of the person for whom the relative count of his group is to be printed.
Output Format:
The first line will contain the count of relatives C in the group of the person with identifier I.
Boundary Conditions:
1 <= N <= 10000
1 <= I <= 1000000
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
10 20
30 20
40 10
55 35
55 22
40
Output:
4
Explanation:
10, 20, 30, 40 form a relative group.
55, 35, 22 form another relative group.
So the count of relatives for the person with identifier 40 is 4.
n=int(input())
l1,l=[],[]
for i in range(n):
    l1.append(list(map(int,input().split())))
for i in range(n):
    for y in l1:
        a,b=y[0],y[1]
        z=0
        for j in l:
            if a not in j and b not in j:
                z+=1 
                continue 
            elif b not in j:
                j.append(b)
            elif a not in j:
                j.append(a)
        if(z==len(l)):
            l.append([a,b])
x=int(input()) 
for j in l:
    if x in j:
        print(len(j))
        exit(0)
