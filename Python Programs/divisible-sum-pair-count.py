Divisible Sum Pair Count
N numbers (A0, A1, A2, ..., AN-1) are passed as input to the program. A positive integer D is also passed as input to the program.
The program must find and print the count C of pairs where Ai + Aj (with i < j) is divisible by D without leaving a remainder.
Input Format:
The first line contains N
The second line contains D
The third line contains the N space separated numbers A0, A1, A2, ..., AN-1
Output Format:
The first line contains the value of C
Boundary Conditions:
2 <= N <= 50
1 <= D <= 1000
1 <= Ai <= 999999

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
3
5 2 1 4 7
Output:
6
Explanation:
The 6 divisible pairs are 5,1 5,4 5,7 2,1 2,4 2,7
a=int(input())
b=int(input());c=0
l=list(map(int,input().split()))
for i in range(a):
  for j in range(i+1,a):
    if (l[i]+l[j])%b==0:c+=1
print(c)
